            <p1 class="width-wide lineheight-tall">This course has taught me so many things about photography. 
                One of the most useful things I've learned to adjust is the focus, this allows me to get more controlled photos and not rely on placement for focus. 
                I've also learned about the different modes offered on most cameras aswell as what they do.

            <p1 class="width-wide lineheight-tall dark">For this assignment, we were tasked with taking 10 photos using perspective. 
                I found it challenging to differentiate just using different angles from using perspective, however I feel that I succesfully captured interesting perspectives in the end.</p1>

            <h2 class="middle-text">Why Did I Learn?</h2>
            <p1 class="width-wide lineheight-tall">This class offers a really nice advantage for web designers because it puts me a step closer to being full stack. 
                This allows me the opportunity to cover more bases when being hired, which also allows me to be paid more per project or for a job. 
                I've also just always been interested in photography since late junior high when I got my first smart phone and took a bunch of photos for instagram because I thought it was fun.</p1>

            <p1 class="width-wide lineheight-tall dark">This assignment focused on color relationships such as monochromatic, complementary, analygous, and one of our choice.
                I enjoyed this because it forced me to look for things that I usually wouldn't search for, I ended up really liking most of these photos. 
                The third photo is my favorite.

            <h2 class="middle-text">In What Ways Is The Knowledge I've Learned Valuable?</h2>
            <p1 class="width-wide lineheight-tall">The information from this class not only helps with becoming closer to being full stack, it also helps with a hobby that I'm interested in.
                When I eventually get my own camera instead of borrowing one from my grandma, I'll be able to use it without needing to learn how it works from scratch. 
                Throughout this class, I took a lot of pictures in or around my house, this shows that you don't need to go on adventures just to capture good photos.</p1>

            <p1 class="width-wide lineheight-tall dark">This assignment forced my to leave my comfort zone by going out to places for my photos to create a photo essay. 
                I ended up having a lot of fun and also got more experience with taking photos while moving rather than stading still.
                The end product is a photo essay of me and my mom traveling through Alton, Elsah, Grafton, and Pere Marquette.

            <p1 class="width-wide lineheight-tall dark">For this assignment, we needed to take colored photos and convert them to black and white.
                I struggled a bit with this one because I've rarely taken photos for black and white, I usually focus on flowers which have vibrant colors.
                I did however end up getting a couple pictures that I liked because they looked eerie and dramatic, my favorite is the pumpkin man portrait.

                <p1 class="lineheight-tall">Performance<br>
                I decided to assign myself a B because I don't believe I submited second drafts of photos for any assignments. 
                I was happy with how they all turned out, however I still chose not to implement others suggestions.</p1>

                <p1 class="lineheight-tall">Progress<br>
                For this category, I assigned an A because I have progressed a lot throughout this semester and have always tried to implement best practices. 
                I also try to give good feedback by using the correct terms when addressing things.</p1>

                Lastly, I chose to give myself an A because I'm really proud of my performance this semester and with all of the photos I've taken.
                As for best practices, I always use the rule of thirds, try to make my subject as prominant as possible, and don't submit blurry photos.</p1>
